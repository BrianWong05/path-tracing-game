# Tasks: Refine Path Generation

1.  **Update Path Logic**
    - [ ] Update `LevelGenerator.ts`
        - [ ] Implement `generateBezierPath` with mandatory curvature (Easy: 20-30%, Medium: 50-80%).
        - [ ] Ensure unique `randomCurveOffset` for variation.
        - [ ] Verify no overlaps in Easy mode.

2.  **Verification**
    - [ ] Verify Easy mode has no straight lines.
    - [ ] Verify Medium mode has distinct deep waves.
